# Project Setup and Progress Tracker

## Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory:**
   Open your terminal and navigate to the backend directory where your `package.json` file is located.

   ```bash
   cd path/to/backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies for the backend:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Backend Server:**
   After the dependencies are installed, you can start the backend server by running:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   The backend should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:5000` (or a different port, depending on your configuration).

## Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory:**
   Open another terminal window and navigate to the frontend directory where the `package.json` file is located.

   ```bash
   cd path/to/frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Install the frontend dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
   After installing the dependencies, start the frontend server with:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   The frontend should now be running on `http://localhost:3000` (or a different port, depending on your configuration).

## Account Creation

1. Open the app on your frontend (typically running on `http://localhost:3000`).
2. Navigate to the **Sign Up** or **Create Account** page.
3. Fill in the required details (username, email, password, etc.).
4. Submit the form to create your account.
5. After successful account creation, you should be redirected to the login page or the dashboard.

   - Go to the **Login** page.
   - Enter the credentials you created during account registration.
   - Submit the form to log in.

2. **Track Your Progress:**
   - Once logged in, you can begin tracking your progress in the app (e.g., tracking tasks, completing milestones, etc.).
   - Use the app's features to monitor your achievements.

3. **Keep Track of Your Updates:**
   - Continue using the app to log your activities.
   - Track any new milestones or completed tasks within the app.

## Notes:
- Ensure both the backend and frontend are running in different terminal windows.
- If you encounter any issues, check the terminal for error logs, and consult the documentation for any specific configurations or dependencies.
